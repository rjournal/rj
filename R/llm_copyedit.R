#' Copyedit article files using an LLM
#'
#' This function applies LLM-based copyediting to all relevant source files in
#' an article directory. It will process BibTeX files, R Markdown files, and
#' LaTeX files (the latter only if there are no R Markdown files).
#' OpenAI's ChapGPT 4.1 is used with the `ellmer` package to perform the copyediting.
#' You will need an OpenAI API key set in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
#' The changes are made directly to the files. Please check carefully before
#' committing them to the git repository.
#'
#' @param article Article id, such as "2025-03".
#' @param type Type of files to copyedit. Options are "all" (default), "bib", "tex", or "rmd".
#' @param ellmer_timeout_s Timeout for the LLM API in seconds. Default is 600 seconds.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' llm_copyedit("2025-05")
#' }

#' @export

Do not change author names except where the author is R Core Team when you can replace it with {R Core Team}. Do not leave comments in the bib file. Return only the corrected bibtex content. The rest of these instructions refer only to title fields and booktitle fields. In these fields, and only in these fields, capitalization of a word or phrase is protected by wrapping it in braces. For example, in the title {Travels in Australia with Fred Bloggs}, we need to protect the capitalization of the proper nouns by writing it as {Travels in {Australia} with {Fred Bloggs}}. Do not change capitalization in titles, and do not remove protected capitalization (i.e., words or phrases wrapped in braces). If a word is in all uppercase, protect its capitalization by wrapping it in braces, unless it is already wrapped in braces. Protect proper nouns and names in titles by wrapping them in braces (e.g., replace R with {R}, C++ with {C++}, United States with {United States}, Bayesian with {Bayesian}, Cox with {Cox}, etc.), unless they are already wrapped in braces. Non-standard capitalization occurs when a word contains a mix of upper and lowercase letters, and at least one uppercase letter that is not at the start of the word. Protect any words with non-standard capitalization by wrapping them in braces, unless they are already wrapped in braces. If a title starts with a lower case letter, protect the capitalization of the initial word by wrapping it in braces. For example, the title {forecast: A package to do forecasting} should be written as {{forecast}: A package to do forecasting}."
