\usage{
make_proof(id, exec = FALSE)

\description{
The `make_proof()` function is the first step to creating an issue. It moves
the 'proofed' articles from the `Accepted` folder and news articles from
`News_items/\{id\}` into `Proofs/\{id\}`.
}
\details{
After the proof is made with this function, `publish_issue()` can be used to
publish these articles into the `rjournal.github.io` repository.
}
