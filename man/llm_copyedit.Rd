\description{
This function applies LLM-based copyediting to all relevant source files in
an article directory. It will process BibTeX files, R Markdown files, and
LaTeX files (the latter only if there are no R Markdown files).
OpenAI's ChapGPT 4.1 is used with the `ellmer` package to perform the copyediting.
You will need an OpenAI API key set in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
The changes are made directly to the files. Please check carefully before
committing them to the git repository.
