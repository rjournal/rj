# Conflict of Interest

## What is a conflict of interest?

For the R Journal, it is important that all decisions taken on papers
are based as much as possible on objective arguments. A conflict of
interest is any situation that may hamper the objectivity of such a
decision. Examples are:

- you are a collaborator in the work discussed in the submission;
- you are a collaborator in a work that somehow competes with the
  submission;
- one or more of the authors of the submission is a co-author or
  collaborator;
- one or more of the authors are friends, family, or colleagues;
- one of the authors has had influence on your professional life, for
  example via funding.

## What to do in case of conflict of interest?

The most important principle is to be transparent.

### For Associate Editors

If you are asked to handle a paper, and you feel there may be a conflict
of interest, always consult the handling executive editor. The EE will
decide whether someone else needs to handle the submission. Regardless
of the decision, the notification and decision will be archived by the
EE.

### For Editors

If you are asked to handle a paper, and you feel there may be a conflict
of interest, consult the Editor-in-Chief. The EE will decide whether
someone else needs to handle the submission. Regardless of the decision,
the notification and decision will be archived by the EE.

### For the Editor-in-Chief

If a submission comes in and you feel there may be a conflict of
interest, never handle the paper yourself. Hand it over to an EE and
explain and archive the conflict of interest.

## How to archive a conflict of interest

Conflicts of interest, and decisions surrounding conflict of interest
should be described in a plain text file called `conflicts.txt` and
stored in the `correspondence` folder with the submission. The
description should at least contain:

- Date
- Reason for possible conflict of interest
- Decision of the executive editor
