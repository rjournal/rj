# Roles and Responsibilities

This vignette gives an overview of the roles in the R Journal editorial
team, the responsibilities that come with each role, and an overview of
the editorial process. There are separate guides that detail the
operational and technical details, in particular:

- [Editor-in-Chief
  Guide](https://rjournal.github.io/rj/articles/editor_in_chief_guide.md)
- [Executive Editor
  Guide](https://rjournal.github.io/rj/articles/executive_editors_guide.md)
- [Associate Editor
  Guide](https://rjournal.github.io/rj/articles/associate_editors_guide.md)

## Roles and responsibilities in the editorial team

The editorial team consists of four Executive Editors (EE), one of which
is the Editor-in-Chief (EIC). The EEs are supported by a team of
Associate Editors.

The team of EEs follow a rotating schedule. A new member will act as EE
for 2 years, takes the role of EIC in year 3, and returns to EE for
their last year.

AEs are in principle appointed for three years, but extensions are
possible if both the EEs and AE agree.

All members of the editorial team are expected to take appropriate
action in the case of conflicts of interest. See the [conflict of
interest
policy](https://rjournal.github.io/rj/articles/conflict_of_interest.md).

### Editor-in-Chief

The EIC is responsible for:

- production of four journal issues per year, one per quarter;
- timely and proper handling of submitted papers;
- distributing the article workload amongst the EEs;
- ensuring there are always four EEs and sufficient AEs to handle the
  workload;
- resolving conflicts between authors and the Journal, where necessary
  in collaboration with the advisory board;
- maintaining the [R Journal website](http://journal.r-project.org);
- maintaining the [`rj` package](https://rjournal.github.io/rj/) used by
  the editorial team to conduct operations for the R Journal;
- organizing monthly meetings for the EE team, bimonthly meetings for
  the AE team, and an annual meeting with the advisory board.

### Executive Editors

An EE is responsible for:

- proper and timely handling of papers under their responsibility;
- making the editorial decision (Accept/Minor/Major/Reject) for papers
  under their responsibility;
- ensuring that both the reviews and the decision on submissions are
  properly argued, and that this argumentation is both archived and
  communicated to the authors;
- communicating with the AE and the authors of submissions;
- supporting the EIC in recruiting AEs and EEs.

EEs may choose to hand over a paper to an AE but they will typically
also handle some papers themselves. For those papers, the EE also takes
on the responsibilities of an AE.

### Associate Editors

An AE is responsible for:

- finding and recruiting appropriate reviewers, such that there are
  preferably at least two reviews of sufficient quality for each
  submission;
- ensuring that both the article contents and the code are sufficiently
  reviewed;
- ensuring timely handling of papers under their responsibility;
- advising the EE on the recommended editorial decision
  (Accept/Minor/Major/Reject).

## Editorial Procedure

When handling a new submission, there are several points of decision.
Here we detail who takes each decision and in which order. The way
decisions are made can be found in the AE, EE and EIC guides.

When a (re)submission arrives

1.  **The EIC decides whether it can be assigned to an EE.** The
    decision is based on technical checks, including completeness,
    formatting, and reproducibility. If the checks are not passed, the
    paper is rejected and the authors could be asked to possibly
    resubmit. If all checks pass, the EIC assigns the paper to an EE.
2.  **The EE decides whether the submission is of sufficient quality for
    review.**
3.  The paper is assigned to an AE or handled by the EE.
    1.  Reviewers are recruited by EE or AE. They ensure that enough
        reviews of sufficient quality are obtained.
    2.  If an AE handles the paper, the AE advises the EE on a decision.
4.  **The EE decides whether the reviews are of sufficient quality to
    support an argued decision**. Reviews should be clear, objective,
    and together cover both the paper and the R code.
5.  **The EE makes the editorial decision: Accept/Minor revision/Major
    revision/Reject**. The EE also archives the decision and
    communicates it with the authors.
