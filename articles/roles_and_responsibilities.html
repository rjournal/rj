<p><em>This document is a proposal, and does not (yet) reflect current
policy of the R Journal</em></p>
<p>This vignette gives an overview of the roles in the R Journal
editorial team, the responsibilities that come with each role, and an
overview of the editorial process. There are separate guides that detail
the operational and technical details, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="associate_editors_guide.html">Associate Editor
Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="executive_editors_guide.html">Executive Editor
Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="editor_in_chief_guide.html">Editor in Chief Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities-in-the-editorial-team">Roles and responsibilities in the editorial team<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#roles-and-responsibilities-in-the-editorial-team"></a>
</h2>
<p>The editorial team consists of four Executive Editors (EE), of which
one is the Editor-in-Chief (EIC). The EEs are supported by a team of
Associate Editors.</p>
<p>The team of EEs follow a rotating schedule. A new member will act as
EE for 2 years, takes the role of EIC in year 3, and returns to EE for
their last year.</p>
<p>AEs are in principle appointed for three years, but extensions are
possible if both the EEs and AE agree.</p>
<p>All members of the editorial team are expected to take appropriate
action in the case of conflicts of interest. See the <a href="conflict_of_interest.html">conflict of interest policy</a>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="editor-in-chief">Editor-in-Chief<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#editor-in-chief"></a>
</h3>
<p>The EIC is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality and publication of the Journal;</li>
<li>timely and proper handling of submitted papers;</li>
<li>ensuring staffing of the EE and AE teams;</li>
<li>resolving conflicts between authors and the Journal, where necessary
in collaboration with the advisory board.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the EIC distributes the article workload amongst the
EEs. The EIC organizes biweekly meetings for the EE team, monthly
meetings for the AE team, and an annual meeting with the advisory board.
The EIC also ensures that there are always four EEs and sufficient AEs
to handle the workload. Finally, the EIC ensures that the quarterly
issues are produced and published.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="executive-editors">Executive Editors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#executive-editors"></a>
</h3>
<p>An EE is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>proper and timely handling of papers under their
responsibility;</li>
<li>making the editorial decision (Accept/Minor/Major/Reject) for papers
under their responsibility;</li>
<li>communicating with the authors;</li>
<li>supporting the EIC in recruiting AEs and EEs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the EE communicates with AE and with the authors of
submissions. They ensure that both the reviews and the decision on
submissions are properly argued, and that this argumentation is both
archived and communicated to the authors.</p>
<p>EEs may choose to hand over a paper to an AE but they will typically
also handle some papers themselves. For those papers, the EE also takes
on the responsibilities of an AE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="associate-editors">Associate Editors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#associate-editors"></a>
</h3>
<p>An AE is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>finding and recruiting appropriate reviewers, such that there are
preferably at least two reviews of sufficient quality for each
submission;</li>
<li>ensuring that both the article contents and the code are
sufficiently reviewed;</li>
<li>ensuring timely handling of papers under their responsibility;</li>
<li>advising the EE on the editorial decision
(Accept/Minor/Major/Reject).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="editorial-procedure">Editorial Procedure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#editorial-procedure"></a>
</h2>
<p>When handling a new submission, there are several points of decision.
Here we detail who takes each decision and in which order. The way
decisions are made can be found in the AE, EE and EIC guides.</p>
<p>When a (re)submission arrives</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>The EIC decides whether it can be assigned to an
EE.</strong> The decision is based on technical checks, including
completeness, formatting, and reproducibility. If the checks are not
passed, the paper is rejected and the authors could be asked to possibly
resubmit. If all checks pass, the EIC assigns the paper to an EE.</li>
<li><strong>The EE decides whether the submission is of sufficient
quality for review.</strong></li>
<li>The paper is assigned to an AE or handled by the EE.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Reviewers are recruited by EE or AE. They ensure that enough reviews
of sufficient quality are obtained.</li>
<li>If an AE handles the paper, the AE advises the EE on a
decision.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The EE decides whether the reviews are of sufficient quality
to support an argued decision</strong>. Reviews should be clear,
objective, and together cover both the paper and the R code.</li>
<li>
<strong>The EE makes the editorial decision: Accept/Minor
revision/Major revision/Reject</strong>. The EE also archives the
decision and communicates it with the authors.</li>
