</h2>
<p>As an Associate Editor, you will receive manuscripts from one of the
four current Editors. You will be responsible for the following
steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the paper and decide if it needs reviews. If you feel that the
article is not sufficient quality for the R Journal, you can provide a
review yourself and recommend rejection, without obtaining any other
reviews. You can also request (via the Editor) further refinement of the
paper before you send it to reviewers.</li>
<li>Find reviewers. If you feel that the paper needs expert reviews, you
will need to find at least two reviewers with expertise in the subject
area of the submission. (See below for some tips on finding reviewers.)
Reviewers are given approximately 1–3 months to review a paper.</li>
<li>Make a recommendation. You should recommend one of the following
options: reject, accept with major revisions, accept with minor
revisions, or accept as is.</li>
<li>Write a short summary explaining the reason for the recommendation.
Ultimately it is the handling editor who makes the final decision on a
paper, and manages all communication with authors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The expected workload is 1–2 papers per month.</p>
<p>Terms are for three years, with an opportunity to renew.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="communication">Communication<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communication"></a>
</h2>
<p>Each AE is provided a Github repo for handling papers, with the name
in the form of <code>ae-articles-XX</code>. When you receive an article
from an editor, you will find it in the <code>Submissions</code> folder
of your repo.</p>
<p>Slack is used for communication between editors and associate
editors, and general information about operations. The channel for AEs
is <code>associate-editors</code> and there are numerous other channels
focusing on different aspects of operations, including
<code>rj-software</code>, <code>general</code>,
<code>journal-website</code>, that you are welcome to join. This is the
best place to receive messages from an editor that a paper is assigned
to you, and for you to notify that editor when you have received
reviews, made your summary and are ready to hand it back.</p>
<p>Meetings with the Editors and Associate Editors will usually be held
monthly. The meeting time is set by the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Email is usually the best way to communicate with reviewers.</p>
<p>Please do not communicate directly with authors. The Editor is
responsible for all communication with authors. You should only be
communicating with reviewers and with the handling editor who allocated
you the paper.</p>

<p>All submissions you are handling will be in your Github repository,
in the <code>Submissions</code> folder. Each submission is in a separate
folder named with the ID of the article; e.g., <code>2024-12</code>.
This folder will contain a number of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>article files: <code>RJwrapper.tex</code>, <code>.tex</code>,
<code>.bib</code>, and possibly <code>.R</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, data
and figure files.</li>
<li>our operation files:
<ul>
<li>
<code>DESCRIPTION</code>: contains up to date information about the
state of the article. It is plain text but you should use the
<code>rj</code> function to modify it, if possible.</li>
<li>
<code>correspondence</code> folder, usually containing
<code>motivating-letter.pdf</code>. This is also where the invitations
to each reviewer will be added, and the reviews will be stored once they
have been returned by reviewers.</li>

<h3 id="potential-reviewers">Potential reviewers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#potential-reviewers"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are several ways to find reviewers for a paper.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>Match keywords against the reviewer database.</p>
<p>We have a list of potential reviewers that has been collected using
this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8EmpF85ASWqPHXqV0vdQd-GHhNBaAZZEYf4qxO3gTl-eGyA/viewform" class="external-link">form
for people to volunteer to review for the R Journal</a>. Please complete
this form yourself.</p>
<p>This form populates a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1stC58tDHHzjhf63f7PhgfiHJTJkorvAQGgzdYL5NTUQ/edit#gid=1594007907" class="external-link">spreadsheet</a>
that is used to match keywords between articles and reviewers. Once you
are set up as an AE, you need access to this sheet in order to use the
<code><a href="../reference/match_keywords.html">rj::match_keywords()</a></code> function. You can request access from
the assigning editor if it isn’t visible to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for authors of related R packages. The submission may cite
some similar packages, or you may find similar packages on a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/" class="external-link">CRAN Task View</a>. Authors
of similar packages are often the best reviewers, and are usually
motivated to review a paper that is related to their own work.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for authors of recent related papers. These may be papers
cited in the submission, or papers that you find via a Google Scholar
search. Restrict your search to papers that are published in the last
few years.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have a list of a few potential reviewers, check their
websites to determine (a) how active they are in the area; (b) how
senior they are; and (c) whether they appear to be R users. The ideal
reviewer is someone who is actively working in the area, uses R, and
does not have substantial management responsibilities. Post-docs or
junior faculty are often the best reviewers, as they have more time than
senior academics, and more experience than PhD students. Someone with
substantial expertise in the topic, but who is not an R user, may still
be able to provide helpful comments on the paper, but they are less
likely to be able to provide useful comments on the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Rank your reviewers in preference order. You will need to invite
at least two reviewers, and it is best to have some in reserve in case
one of the first two declines. Think about who is most likely to agree;
e.g., someone is more likely to agree if they know you.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible, try to find reviewers with different expertise.
For example, one may have stronger expertise in the statistical methods,
with the other having greater expertise in writing R packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Before sending them, edit the review-request emails to explain
why you’re asking them to review the submission. For example, “As the
author of package X, I’d be interested in your thoughts on this
submission.” Or “I’m aware of your JRSSB paper on XXX, so I’m keen to
get your thoughts on this submission which takes a different approach to
the same problem.” Or “The authors compare their package against the
method you developed in XXX, so I’d like to know your views on this
submission.” If they know why you asked them, they are more likely to
respond positively.</p></li>
<li><p>If you only manage to get one review, you may need to provide a
review yourself.</p></li>
