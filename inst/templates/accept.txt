Dear {{name}},

Congratulations, your submission to the R journal is now accepted. The RJournal currently published four issues per year. Your paper will probably appear in the issue for the quarter in which it was accepted. Next, please:

Check your paper against the checklist provided at https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/check_functions.html and also that the formatting adheres to the advice at https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/format-details.html

Once you've done that, please respond to this email with a full copy of the files for your article as a zip archive.

Prior to publication, the paper will be proofed by a copy-editor and requested changes will be sent to you to make, with a short turn-around time.

As an R Journal author, if you are not already, we would be delighted to have your expertise as a reviewer for future submissions; please fill in your details here: https://journal.r-project.org/contribute.html#reviewers

Regards,
