---
Dear {{firstname}},

Would you be willing to review the attached article, "{{title}}" for the R Journal? I think the topic is a good fit with your interests and expertise.

The structure of this review is up to you, but it's usually about a page long and should include:

* Overview: Is the article important to R the community? Is the approach sensible? Are technology and methods up-to-date?

* Article: Is anything unclear? Is anything missing? Are the examples helpful? Is there sufficient background, including alternative approaches in R?

* Package: Could the functions presented be improved? Some ideas at http://bit.ly/1aYwkp3. Could the code be improved? Some good advice on code style can be found in
    - "R packages" chapter 7 by Hadley Wickham at https://r-pkgs.org/r.html,

    - "What I look for in 'Software Papers'" by Carl Boettiger at https://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/06/13/what-I-look-for-in-software-papers.html

    - and avoiding the features warned against by Jenny Bryan at https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/

Reviews should be returned by email. Our preferred format for the review is a text file attachment, but a pdf is also acceptable. This will be sent on to the authors. Your email should also give your overall recommendation (this part is for the editor only): Accept with minor revisions (you won't see it again), accept with major revisions (you'll re-review the revisions), or reject.


Please let me know if you are willing to take on this review. (If you have a conflict of interest, we request that you decline the invitation. )

I would like to receive the review, if possible, by {{date}}.

Regards,

{{me}}
