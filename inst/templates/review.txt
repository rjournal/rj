Subject: Review for the R journal {{id}}
---
Dear {{name}},

Would you be willing to review the attached article, "{{title}}" for the R Journal? I think the topic is a good fit with your interests and expertise. The structure of the review is up to you, but it's usually about a page long and should include:

* Overall recommendation: Accept with minor revisions (you won't see it again), accept with major revisions (you'll re-review the revisions), or reject.

* Overview: Is the article important to R the community? Is the approach sensible? Are technology and methods up-to-date?

* Article: Is anything unclear? Is anything missing? Are the examples helpful? Is there sufficient background, including alternative approaches in R?

* Package: Could the functions presented be improved? Some ideas at http://bit.ly/1aYwkp3. Could the code be improved, for example using the "styler" package, or have the features warned against by Jenny Bryan at https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/

Reviews are usually anonymous and should be returned by email. Please let me know if you are willing to take on this review. I would like to receive the review, if possible, by {{date}}.

Regards,

{{me}}
